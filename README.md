## [SOM](/SOM)
Numpy and pyTorch implementations of Kohonen's Self-organizing maps (SOM).

## [AlexNet XAS](/AlexNet%20XAS/alexnet_structure_prediction.ipynb)
A simple demo how to utilize Transfer learning approach: prediction of the structural parameters of water from its XAS (X-ray absorbtion spectroscopy) spectrum, using trained AlexNet as a feature extractor from the images on the spectra.

## [Finite Elements Analysis](/Finite%20Elements%20Analysis/finite_elements.ipynb)
A simple implementation of the numeric solution of 2D Laplace equation using Finite Elements.

## [Molecular Fragments](/MolecularFragments/molecular_fragments.ipynb)
To deduce the list of fragments from the molecule as a result of ion decomposition, e.g. during X-ray coincidence spectrospoy experiment. Molecule is given in SMILES format. Returns list of fragments with its masses, also in LaTeX format, as well as fragments with a given mass.
